# Protractor
For this task I went with the protractor automation framework. Protractor is a framework built on top of WebDriverJS used to test angular applications. It follows the similar patterns of Mocha.  
More info on the framework can be found here https://www.protractortest.org/#/

# Installation steps
* Prerequisite: clone repo

Install protractor to the device you'd like to run the test
1. Run 'npm install -g protractor' to install protractor
2. Run the following command 'webdriver-manager update'
3. After installation is done run 'webdriver-manager start'
  * This will start your webdriver instance
4. Open terminal and navigate to the repo directory
5. Once you are in the cookie repo run the following command to execute the 
'protractor conf.js'
